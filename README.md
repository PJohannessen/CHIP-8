# CHIP-8

Yet another CHIP-8 emulator/interpreter, this one written in C# running on .NET Core 3.1.

This project is purely for fun and self education. There is a wealth of more detailed and accurate resources available. Should I ever complete enough of it I intend to create (yet another) blog series detailing its creation.
